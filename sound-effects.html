                <p>The rain pitter-pattered on the roof top. "Pitter-patter" means light sounds or beats, and often is used to describe the sound of small animals (like cats) as they gently move about. It has a fairly positive and easy-going connotation, and using "pitter-patter" to describe rain invokes a sense of melody and calm.</p>

                <p>Ocean sounds are soft noises with a low frequency and a rhythmic nature. They tell our brains that we are safe. Loud, sudden noises put us on alert, but natural water sounds activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps us relax and unwind.</p>
